Simple snake game that is controlled by the text input of the user. The game board consists of a square matrix, the size of which can be altered as the first argument in the *properties.txt*.
The game spawns in the number of apples (2nd argument in the properties.txt file), and the snake. The game over happens when the snake goes out of bounds or hits its own body.



*The commands to be used to control the snake:*
- move -> move in the current direction 1 square
- move x (x - number) -> move in the current direction x squares
- left/right/up/down -> change orientation of the snake, move one square in that direction



Legend:
- 'a' -> apple
- '*' -> head of the snake
- '+' -> body of the snake
